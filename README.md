Djent Learning
  The way to use:
    1. Put the related clean guitar audio files and drive audio files in directories "codes/data/train/input" and "codes/data/train/input"
    2. Run "codes/djent_learning.py" to create a model and train it. The model will be saved in "codes/data/model"
    3. Put test clean guitar audio files in "codes/data/test/input"
    4. Run "codes/test_with_audio.py", the graphs of test outputs will be shown. The output audio files will be saved in "codes/test/output" after closing the graph windows.
